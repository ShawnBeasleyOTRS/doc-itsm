ITSM Configuration Management
=============================

The configuration management database (CMDB) is not a database in the technical sense, but a conceptual IT model, which is indispensable for efficient IT service management. All IT components and inventories are managed in the CMDB. Configuration management exceeds asset management, often incorrectly used as a synonym, as it does not only document assets from a financial point of view, but captures information regarding the relationship between components, specifications, or their location. Thus IT support can quickly access information on the interdependence of IT services and the IT components (aka. configuration items or CIs) necessary for them.
