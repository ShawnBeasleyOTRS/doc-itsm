    <title>Service Level Management</title>
    <para>
        The introduction of OTRS version 2.1 marked a complete revision of the
internal statistics framework by allowing the creation of nearly every
imaginable ticket-based report via the web interface, as well as the export
or import thereof. In addition to that, by making use of OTRS existing
access conrol features, administrators were allowed to restrict the
generation and display of statistics and charts to specific users, groups,
and/or roles.  During the development, special care was given to ensure
cross-version compatibility, meaning that statistics modules generated by
previous OTRS versions could continue to be used. When used in combination
with OTRS::ITSM, additional statistics relevant to ITSM become available
with the installation of the ITSMServiceLevelManagement package.
