    <title>The CMDB - the central IT repository</title>
    <para>The configuration management database (CMDB) is not a database in the technical sense but a conceptual IT model, which is indispensable for efficient IT service management. All IT components and inventories are managed in the CMDB. Configuration management exceeds asset management, often incorrectly used as a synonym, as it does not only document assets from a financial point of view, but captures information regarding the relationship between components, specifications or their location. Thus IT support can quickly access information on the interdependence of IT services and the IT components (= configuration items = CIs) necessary for them.</para>
    <para>According to ITIL, a CMDB must feature the following functionalities:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
        <para>manual and, where applicable, automatic recording and modification of configuration items</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>description of the relationship and/or interdependence between CIs</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>change of CI attributes (e.g. serial numbers)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>location and user management for CIs</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>integration via the ITIL processes represented in the system</para>
    </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>OTRS::ITSM meets all requirements stated above and offers numerous additional IT support functions in the CMDB.

        <title>The OTRS::ITSM database model</title>
        <para>
            The modular architecture of OTRS::ITSM and the ability to install single OTRS::ITSM packages independently,
            make it difficult to display a complete database model in a single graphic. For this reaeon, separate
            graphics will be provided for the OTRS framework and for ITSM packages which change or extend the database
            scheme.

    <title>Services, at the core of everything</title>
    <para>Services such as &quot;standard IT workstation&quot;, &quot;e-mail&quot; or &quot;web access are IT products and should at all costs be compiled in a so called IT service catalog prior to the adoption of OTRS::ITSM. Such service catalogs are usually customer or company specific, can be structured hierarchically and should be formulated in a user friendly, i.e. easily understood, language, as they can be accessed by IT personnel (agents) and IT users (customers).
</para>
    <warning>
        <para>Service catalog design is a task which should not be underestimated. Our experience shows that it is highly recommendable to validate conceptual thoughts in a dry run first and transfer the service structures to OTRS::ITSM in a second step. It has proven of value to resort to external assistance, e.g. of ITIL practice experts. </para>

    <para>OTRS::ITSM offers up to 99 different calendars by default to describe the various time zones for work or service times. The SLAs can be allocated to them (&quot;service level window&quot;).

    <para>Using the FAQ system, which is an independent external module since OTRS 2.1, a knowledge database  can be designed and managed, e.g. for suggestions and/or procedures related to the resolution of known errors.</para>
    <para>Entries can be provided for internal use only, for all customers or the public. They can be created and sorted according to language or categories. The quality of FAQ articles can be evaluated by agents. The number of articles last created or last revised to be displayed can be configured without any limitations. All articles can be indexed for an efficient search. </para>

    <title>Changes and amendments to the data model</title>
    <para>The data model can be adapted flexibly and can be extended with data types, attributes and even classes. Detailed information can be found in the section "The admin area of OTRS::ITSM" in this document or in "The admin area of OTRS" in the OTRS Admin Manual.
</para>
    <warning>
        <para>The design of a CMDB data model and the CIs to be managed within it is a task which should not be underestimated. Our experience shows that it is highly recommendable to validate conceptual thoughts in a dry run against the existing IT infrastructure first and change the OTRS::ITSM default data model and CI classes only afterwards. It has proven of value to resort to external assistance, e.g. of ITIL practice experts for CMDB design. </para>

    <sect1>
    <title>Ticket types and attributes</title>
    <para>With OTRS 2.2, native ticket types were introduced, which are used in OTRS::ITSM, too. In the ITIL sub-processes which can be structured in queues, tickets are classified on their ticket types. </para>
    <para>All ITIL processes to be implemented in later versions of OTRS::ITSM, e.g. change management, will be implemented in such a way. Ticket types such as RfC (&quot;Request for Change&quot;) could be created.

        <para>In order to assure the consistency of the data managed in OTRS::ITSM, information created in the admin area of the system cannot be deleted as a general rule.
