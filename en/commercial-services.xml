    <title>Commercial services for OTRS ITSM</title>
    <para>OTRS AG is the manufacturer and source code owner of OTRS and all
        modules based upon it (e.g. OTRS ITSM) and a professional service
        provider. Unlike those of proprietary software providers, OTRS AG's
        business model is not based on license fees: OTRS and OTRS ITSM are
        available free of cost and we offer commercial services associated
        with the software applications instead. </para>

        of your OTRS project design, realization, and operation. Our staff are
        highly skilled experts and we believe in deploying the most modern

        applications and happy customers lauding our service quality
        (http://www.otrs.com/en/references/). </para>

        <title>Software development</title>
        <para>One significant advantage of the open-source software OTRS ITSM
            is its flexibility regarding potential extensions of the functional
            range. No "vendor lock-in", a typical risk of proprietary systems and
            protracted negotiations with the manufacturer about expanding the
            functional range or building interfaces apply with OTRS ITSM. </para>
        <para>Experienced project managers and developers are at your disposal
            at any time to translate your requirements exceeding the functional
            range of OTRS ITSM into business and IT specifications. We develop
            your features, program interfaces, or upgrade existent functionalities
            according to your conception. </para>
        <para>Extensions, which are useful for other customers too, will be
            added to the standard in later releases. All parties involved
            benefit: OTRS ITSM is even more powerful with the features "born" by
            you and other customers, and you save the cost of porting your
            features to new releases. </para>

        <title>Application support</title>
        <para>The decision for an IT service management solution is an
            investment into the future which should not be underestimated, even
            if you opt for open-source software. A competent consulting partner
            is critical for the success of such an implementation project. Just
            as important, however, is a planned and successful porting of the
            solution to the life system and the lasting support of a reliable
            partner guaranteeing a faultless operating application service.
        </para>
        <para>We provide this continuous support and our service packages are
            tailored flexibly to meet your requirements. They offer
            differentiated response times for the various service level
            agreements with up to 24/7/365 support, 24/7/365 access to our
            support portal, and optional phone support. Please visit
            http://www.otrs.com/en/support/ for all details or contact our sales
            team at sales@otrs.com.</para>
        <para>You will only pay for the services you absolutely need. Optional
            add-on packages, e.g. support via remote control or an extension of
            the application support services to other OTRS ITSM instances can be
            booked if required.</para>
        <para>Our ITIL compliant operating Application Support Team is
            continually optimizing its processes and performance. Therefore, our
            service manager will contact you regularly to discuss your wishes and
            requirements regarding our services. The monthly service reporting in
            the service package of your choice serves as a base for these
            conversations.</para>

        <title>Managed application services (ASP/SaaS)</title>
        <para>You do not have to operate OTRS and/or OTRS ITSM yourself. The
            products can be rented via the so called &quot;ASP&quot; (application
            service provisioning) resp. &quot;SaaS&quot; (software as a service)
            model from specialized companies.</para>
        <para>The customers (software users) are permitted internet access to
            exclusively rented OTRS systems and, where required, functional
            application support (see section above) at a fixed monthly price and
            can employ the application in their business to the contracted
            extent. No additional license fees apply as only open-source products
            are used.</para>
        <para>The application service provider operates IT infrastructure,
            systems and software ITIL compliantly and guarantees service quality
            according to the agreed service levels. The provider maintains the
            application system, (e.g. patches, backup, monitoring), and supports
            the customer with incidents and/or service requests such as
            consultation requests, software extensions, or configuration requests.
