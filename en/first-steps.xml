    <title>First steps in OTRS ITSM</title>
    <para>
       The first thing that you might notice is that OTRS ITSM completely uses the agent and customer interfaces
	   (customer frontend) implemented in OTRS. If OTRS has been used before,
        all features and steps such as login, queue configuration, user
        preferences, filters, rules, user permissions, etc. can continue to be
        used without any modifications.

        The manual at hand will therefore only discuss differences between
        OTRS and new aspects of OTRS ITSM, while paying particular attention to the following:

        Detailed information on the settings and proceedings that are identical in both
        OTRS and OTRS ITSM are provided at http://doc.otrs.org/3.2/en/html/
        in the OTRS Admin Manual, which is cotinuously being revised.
