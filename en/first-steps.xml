    <title>First steps in OTRS::ITSM</title>
    <para>
       The firt thing that you might notice is that OTRS::ITSM uses the agent and customer interfaces
        (customer frontend) we first implemented with our core OTRS product. Therefore if you have previous
        experience with using OTRS, you should see many familiar features and feel right at home. Even better, if you 
        have an existing OTRS install, all features and steps such as login, queue configuration, user
        preferences, filters, rules, user permissions etc. can continued to be used without any additional work.
