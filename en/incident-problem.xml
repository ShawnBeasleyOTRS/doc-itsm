    <title>Service desk, incident, &amp; problem management</title>
    <para>The service desk (which, according to ITIL, is not a process but a function) is usually the ticket system's main field of application. All user messages and notifications from system monitoring and internal IT organization converge here. The ITIL service management process, closely interweaved with the service desk, describes which work steps, information, escalations, and/or interfaces are relevant in connection with the processing of incidents or service requests. </para>
    <para>The incident and problem management processes within OTRS ITSM are based on ITIL recommendations and ITIL terminology. At the same time, user comfort was a main consideration, and terms known from OTRS have been retained as much as possible.</para>

    <title>Ticket creation, classification and prioritization</title>
    <para>At ticket creation -in our case a phone ticket- the following information can be registered in addition to the information implemented in OTRS:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>ticket type</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>relevant service</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>SLA</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>impact</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>priority</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Depending on the service selected, impact and priority are automatically submitted from the criticality impact priority matrix. However, every IT service staff member knows a "VIP" customer requires special consideration.</para>
    <para>In order to meet this requirement of day-to-day Service Operations, we also allow you to manually adjust the priority of a request.</para>

    </para>
    <para>By following the ticket content (zoom) link, detailed information about the ticket can be accessed. All data relevant for IT support is consolidated in the right hand section:</para>

    <title>SLA relevant time information</title>
    <para>With the additional ITSM fields link, time information additional to the response, update, and solution time provided in the SLA can be recorded and existing information can be changed:

    <title>Allocate tickets (queues)</title>
    <para>Designed with flexibility in mind, the OTRS ITSM queues can be tailored to your organizational structures. They can follow the vertical scheme of service desk, first, second, and third level support (as often used in IT service support) or be configured in a process oriented manner based on the ticket life cycle of generation, processing, closure and post-processing. </para>
    <para>Contrary to OTRS versions prior to version 2.2, ticket escalation in OTRS ITSM is based first of all on the response, update and recovery times provided in the SLA.
If no values are provided in the SLA, escalation is effected based on the queues and time information stored in them.  </para>
    <para>Tickets can be moved by choosing a new queue in the bottom right corner of the ticket view.</para>
    <para>

        </screenshot>
    </para>
    <warning>
        <para>The design of a queue structure is a task which should not be underestimated. Our experience shows that it is highly recommendable to validate conceptual thoughts in a dry run against the existing IT infrastructure before configuring OTRS ITSM. It has proven of value to resort to external assistance, e.g. of OTRS or ITIL practice experts for the queue design.

    <title>Change ticket data</title>
    <para>All changes to the ticket can be effected just as in OTRS using the links below the navigation bar. </para>

    <title>Approvals and decisions</title>
    <para>In many cases, especially with service requests, decisions have to be taken before requests can be implemented. Depending on the competence framework, decisions are either taken directly by the service staff (standard changes) or by the approval of a supervising manager must be obtained first. This is primarily the case with permission changes (a user wants to access a restricted file system directory) or cost generating requests (new laptop).</para>
    <para>In OTRS ITSM approvals and refusals are shown via the decision link and are permanently saved with the ticket:</para>

    <title>Generation of problem tickets from incidents</title>
    <para>To generate a problem ticket from one or more incidents, generate a new ticket and link it with the relevant incident tickets. This way, the underlying incidents can be processed individually, can be closed with a workaround if necessary, and later be substituted with a permanent solution.</para>
    <para>A merging of incident and problem tickets obscures the reporting and complicates controlling and the continuous improvement of the IT services.
</para>

    <sect1>
    <title>Ticket closure</title>
    <para>Unlike the OTRS standard, OTRS ITSM facilitates ITIL compliant ticket closure with a workaround.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
    <title>Processing of service requests</title>
    <para>Within OTRS, service requests and incidents are both regarded as tickets and intially processed equally. They are distinguishable from disruptions because of the ticket type Incident::Service Request.</para>
    <para>Another difference, the SLA relevant times, is explained in greater detail in the service levels and service level agreements section.</para>
