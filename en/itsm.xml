    <title>OTRS ITSM - OTRS for IT service management</title>
    <para>
        IT is expected to consistently deliver high service quality in an
        increasingly complex field. In this context, effective and efficient
        incident and problem management are indispensable. However, IT service
        management remains a task almost impossible if there is no consistent
        and up-to-date database with information about the state and
        configuration of the IT infrastructure.
    </para>
    <para>
        The IT Infrastructure Library®, short ITIL®, is a series of books
        published by the United Kingdom's Office of Government Commerce (OGC),
        which generically combine best practice approaches to designing,
        providing, operating and managing IT services. ITIL does not focus on
        the technology but the services provided by the IT and comprises
        information on processes, roles, responsibilities, potential problem
        fields/resolutions, and definitions of terms.
    </para>
    <para>
        ITIL has established itself as de facto standard over the past
        years and its circulation in IT organizations has contributed considerably
        to the development of a collective awareness and consistent
        terminology for IT service management. However, ITIL only describes
        &quot;who should do what&quot; and what should be considered along the
        way. In order to cover as wide a user group as possible, it does not
        or to a little extent address the issue of how to do things.
        Therefore, no implementable information is given for particular
        industries, companies, or manufacturers.
    </para>
    <para>
        In December 2005, the ITIL based ISO/IEC 20000 industry standard
        for IT service management was published. IT organizations can apply
        for ISO/IEC 20000 certification and prove their conformity.
    </para>
    <para>
        The continuing boom caused demand for IT service management
        tools, which could represent the ITIL-based processes. So far, only
        proprietary solutions existed. Because of their considerable
        complexity, most of these tools are only affordable for large
        companies and effective in large IT departments.
    </para>
    <para>
        The development of OTRS ITSM was started as a result of the
        great success of the OTRS framework in order to combine the
        globally accepted, public ITIL recommendations with the benefits
        of open-source software.
    </para>
    <para>
        OTRS ITSM 1.0 was the first real-world ITIL compliant IT service
        management solution on open-source basis, built on the solid basis
        of OTRS with its over 55,000 known OTRS installations and its
        community (information dating from April 2007). OTRS ITSM is under
        active development and new features are added continuously.
    </para>
    <para>
        OTRS ITSM is practically-oriented. This was accomplished by
        developing it in collaboration with ITIL consultants and with
        some of OTRS Groups' customers.
    </para>
    <para>
        The service-desk and ticket system solution OTRS is the basis
        for the ITIL compliant IT service management solution
        OTRS ITSM, its incident management, problem management, service level
        management, change and configuration management modules, and integrated
        CMDB.

            OTRS ITSM 3.3 is based on OTRS 3.3.
            All functionalities known from OTRS continue to be available and the
            functionalities representing ITIL processes can be installed as
            packages.

                            have been reimplemented in AJAX technology to reduce necessary

                            As a consequence, the Object-Link functionality of OTRS couldn't
                            be used in OTRS ITSM. A joint Object-Link mechanism has now
                            been implemented, which covers all of the features from both former

                            A view on services and CIs, including information
                            on each object's current state, allows you to analyze an incident
                            and calculate the incident's impact on affected services and
                            customers.

                            As an enhancement of the service view, now SLAs and linked CIs are
                            also displayed.
                            For each CI, the current incident state is shown. In addition, the incident
                            state
                            will be propagated for dependent SLAs and CIs.

                            If a service is selected, the service details will be shown, now
                            with the additional
                            'current incident state', which is calculated from the incident states of

                        <para>
                            This feature offers the possibility to import or update data from CSV
                            files into the CMBD of OTRS ITSM, and to export data from the
                            CMDB to CSV files.
                            Each line of the CSV file describes one CI, with the data of the CI
                            in the columns.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The import and export is controlled with ImEx definitions. These
                            definitions map the columns of the CSV file to the fields in the
                            CMDB. You can create an ImEx definition via the admin interface
                            in OTRS. For each available field in the CMDB, the corresponding
                            column in the CSV file needs to be defined. This is done in a
                            form, which represents the current CI definition. Also, a filter
                            can be applied, to limit the number of the exported CIs.
                            Any number of ImEx definitions can be stored in the system, and each
                            definition can be used for import and for export.
                        </para>

                            To start an import (exports work the same way), two possibilities
                            exist: interactive with the web interface, or automatically with
                            a script.
                            Using the interactive way, the desired ImEx definition is selected,
                            and then the CSV file is uploaded to the system. During the
                            interactive export, the CSV file will be offered for download
                            respectively.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The automatic import is carried out via a script, which requires the
                            name of the ImEx definition and the name of the CSV file as
                            arguments. During the script based export, the CIs that were
                            given the script as arguments will be saved in a CSV file.
                            Before the execution of the import or export, the selected ImEx
                            definition will be compared with the current CI definition. If
                            inconsistencies are found, the process will be cancelled. Also,
                            during import, restrictions in the CI definition (e.g. mandatory
                            fields) will be checked. If applicable, the data record is
                            rejected, but the import process continues. An import protocol
                            can be found in the syslog.
                            Via the API the CSV based import/export can be replaced or enhanced
                            by other formats/transports, like direct database access or XML.
                            The implementation of the CSV interface can be used as a
                            reference.

                        Free-text fields are therefore no longer needed to specify ticket

                        classification do not have to be migrated. The new feature is also
                        shown in the ticket content and in the print view for agents and
                        customers and can be adjusted in the agent interface.

                OTRS ITSM is based on an integrated configuration management
                data base (CMDB), which serves as the foundation for the
                comprehensive control of the service management processes. It
                represents the configuration items (CI), their complex relationships,
                and interdependencies with each other and with other components of
                the service chain.

                        OTRS 2.2 on its way to becoming an IT service management tool.
                        When creating a ticket, the customer can select a service (e.g.
                        e-mail service) and a corresponding SLA. SLA attributes are
                        &quot;response time&quot;, &quot;update time&quot; and
                        &quot;solution time&quot;. IT service can use these attributes for
                        notifications or ticket escalation in order to meet existing SLAs.
                        Service and SLA specific information in the header of new e-mails
                        can be analyzed as usual with the PostMaster filter module.

            A large community has evolved around OTRS throughout the past years. Users
            and developers use mailing lists to share their insights about a wide
            variety of issues connected with the trouble ticket system. They
            address questions about installation, configuration, use,
            localization, and development. Bugs can be reported using the bug
            tracking system at http://bugs.otrs.org (http://bugs.otrs.org/). They
            directly reach the developers responsible and fixes can be provided
