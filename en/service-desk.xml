    <title>ITIL compliant service support with OTRS::ITSM</title>
    <para>
        Just as ITIL, OTRS::ITSM does not claim to be an
        &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; solution for all tasks and questions
        arising in IT service management. It is in fact supposed to serve as a
        flexible, stable and easy to understand information platform.
    </para>
    <para>
        Without the thoughtful adaptation of generic ITIL processes to the individual
        business situation, OTRS::ITSM will confer no marked improvement core
        objective of IT service management to IT organization or customer
        service.</para>
    <para>
        Therefore please excuse our raised finger at this point: The use of an ITIL
        compliant tool such as OTRS::ITSM only makes sense if processes,
        people and products (IT services) really are ITIL compliant. </para>
    <para>

        Successful ITIL implementation projects typically take up to a year and longer.
        A neatly implemented ITIL compliant ITSM tool can help to save time
        and money though, as the process support of the tool supports and
        accelerates the process of rethinking. </para>
    <para>
        OTRS::ITSM 2.0 supports the incident and problem management processes, service
        level management, and configuration management database and change
        management which usually are designed in the first phase of ITIL
        implementation.
        A closer description of use and adaptation of the system can be found
        in the following sections.
        The package names correspond to their respective ITIL topics, each
        package can be installed independently.
    </para>
    <para>
        Implementation of OTRS::ITSM is based on ITIL v3.</para>
