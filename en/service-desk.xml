    <title>ITIL compliant service support with OTRS::ITSM</title>
    <para>
        Just as ITIL, OTRS::ITSM does not claim to be an
        &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; solution for all tasks and questions
        arising in IT service management. It is in fact supposed to serve as a
        flexible, stable and easy to understand information platform.
    </para>
    <para>
        Without the thoughtful tailoring of generic ITIL processes to suit the individual
        business scenario, OTRS::ITSM will not achieve a discernible improvement of the key performance indicators
        of IT service management for the IT organization or its customers..</para>
    <para>
        Therefore please excuse us for bringing the following to your attention: The use of an ITIL
        compliant tool such as OTRS::ITSM only makes sense if processes,
        people and products (IT services) are truly ITIL compliant. </para>
    <para>

        Successful ITIL implementation projects typically take up to a year and longer.
        However, a neatly implemented ITIL compliant ITSM tool can help to save time
        and money though, as the process support of the tool supports and
        accelerates the process of organizational realignment. </para>
    <para>
        OTRS::ITSM 2.0 supports the incident and problem management processes, service
        level management, and the configuration management database as well as change
        management which usually are designed in the first phase of ITIL
        implementation.
        A more detailed description of use and adaptation of the system can be found
        in the following sections.
        The package names correspond to their respective ITIL topics, each
        package can be installed independently.
    </para>
    <para>
        Implementation of OTRS::ITSM is based on ITIL v3.</para>
