    <title>Service Level Management</title>
    <para>
        The introduction of OTRS version 2.1 marked a complete revision of the internal statistics framework
        by allowing the creation of nearly every imaginable ticket-based report via the web interface, as well as the
        export or import thereof. In addition to that, by making use of OTRS existing access control features, administrators
        were allowed to restrict the generation and display of statistics and charts to specific users, groups and/or roles.
        During the development, special care was given to ensure cross-version compatibility, meaning that statistics modules
        generated by previous OTRS versions could continue to be used. When used in combination with OTRS::ITSM, additional
        statistics relevant to ITSM become available with the installation of the ITSMServiceLevelManagement package.
