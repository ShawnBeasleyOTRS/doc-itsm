"The introduction of OTRS version 2.1 marked a complete revision of the "
"internal statistics framework by allowing the creation of nearly every "
"imaginable ticket-based report via the web interface, as well as the export "

"access control features, administrators were allowed to restrict the "
"generation and display of statistics and charts to specific users, groups "
"and/or roles.  During the development, special care was given to ensure "
"cross-version compatibility, meaning that statistics modules generated by "
